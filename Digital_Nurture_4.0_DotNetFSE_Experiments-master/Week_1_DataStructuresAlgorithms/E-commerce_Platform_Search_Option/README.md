## 📚 Understanding Big O Notation

- **Big O** measures the upper limit of an algorithm's time as input grows.
- Helps in comparing performance and scalability.

### 🔸 Search Case Analysis

| Algorithm     | Best Case | Average Case | Worst Case |
|---------------|-----------|--------------|------------|
| Linear Search | O(1)      | O(n)         | O(n)       |
| Binary Search | O(1)      | O(log n)     | O(log n)   |

## 📁 Project Structure

- **Product.cs** – Defines the `Product` class (ID, Name, Category).
- **Program.cs** – Contains:
  - Linear search method
  - Binary search method
  - Sample product list
  - Demo output using both algorithms
